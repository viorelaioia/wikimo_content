=== What you can do with this service ===

* Obtain a detailed view of the security controls deployed on a system, or across an infrastructure.
* Fast iterations on the implementation and review of security controls. This is designed to accelerate the feedback loop between operational and security teams. immediate feedback is necessary.

The Rapid Risk (Impact) Assessment (also called Rapid Risk Analysis) is a 30 minutes or less discussion about the potential risks of a project. The RRA is high level and lightweight.

=== What you can do with this service ===

* Quickly identify risks impacts related to your project, service, tool, etc.
* Make decision making more efficient: spend more time where it matters on your project, service, tool (where the risks are).
* Get your service recorded in a risk heatmap to compare it with other services.
* Find out if you need a threat model.

== Service: Vulnerability Assessment ==

; Support commitment
: Response within a week.
; Costs
: One or more meetings with InfoSec.
; Service request
: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Enterprise%20Information%20Security&component=Vulnerability%20Assessment&assigned_to=jclaudius%40mozilla.com request bug]

=== Description ===

A vulnerability assessment is a semi-automated point-in-time assessment conducted by Mozilla Security using a vulnerability scanner and other “point and shoot” tools for an explicit set of target(s). May include a validation component, depending on scope and service risk.

=== What you can do with this service ===

* Quickly identify commonly known vulnerabilities/misconfigurations in your application ranked by severity
* Get a sense of a vendor systems security posture if the vendor is not forthcoming but is willing to be scanned
* Get a manual verification of vulnerabilities/misconfigurations to weed out false positives (optional - based on scope and risk)

== Service: Threat Modeling ==

; Support commitment
: Response within a week.
; Costs
: One or more meeting with InfoSec.
; Service request
: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Enterprise%20Information%20Security&component=Threat%20Modeling request bug]

=== Description ===

Threat modeling defines a set of attack scenarios to consider against an application. They are more specific, thorough and often more time consuming than Rapid Risk Assessments (RRA).
When a threat model or analysis is requested on a large service (ie, larger than a quick reply in a bug), an RRA is required to ensure that the security recommendations cover the areas of concerns of the service.

=== What you can do with this service ===

* Get an in depth threat model of your project with technical details, recorded in a document.
* Get a quick in-line reply in Bugzilla (responses sec-review flag).
* Get architectural tips from the security point of view at the project design time.

=== Description ===

An adversarial exercise with the goal of demonstrating risks that could be exploited by a threat actor.  Testing scope is heavily influenced by RRA and Threat Modeling results, which should be completed prior to Penetration Testing.

=== What you can do with this service ===

* Get a detailed report of security controls that were tested and found effective/ineffective
* Get recommendations on how to remedy ineffective security controls
* Get proof of concept (PoC) evidence that demonstrates the ineffectiveness of security controls to support development and prioritization efforts

== System call auditing: Audisp-json ==

; Services provided
: Auditing
; Maturity
: Production
; Source code
: https://github.com/gdestuynder/audisp-json

=== Description ===

Linux Audit can record information about any system call, and relay it to a user-space process. Audisp-json is a plugin for Auditd which takes these events, correlate them and issue a standard, single JSON message in the MozDef format -over HTTPS (it does not use syslog).

Audisp-json coupled with MozDef provide a strong solution to monitor and correlate security event on linux systems. It supersede the audisp-cef plugin.

== Trophy Store ==

; Services Provided
: Development
; Maturity
: Alpha
; Source Code
: https://github.com/gene1wood/trophy-store

== MIG: Mozilla InvestiGator ==

; Services Provided
: Endpoint Security
; Maturity
: Production
; Source Code
: http://mig.mozilla.org

=== Description ===

MIG is a platform to perform investigative surgery on remote endpoints. It enables investigators to obtain information from large numbers of systems in parallel, thus accelerating investigation of incidents.

MIG is composed of agents installed on all systems of an infrastructure. The agents can be queried in real-time using a messaging protocol implemented in the MIG Scheduler. MIG has an API, a database, RabbitMQ relays and a console client. It allows investigators to send actions to pools of agents, and check for indicator of compromise, verify the state of a configuration, block an account, create a firewall rule, update a blacklist and so on.

== MozDef: The Mozilla Defense Platform ==

; Services Provided
: Development
; Maturity
: Production
; Source Code
: http://mozdef.com

=== Description ===

The Mozilla Defense Platform (MozDef) seeks to automate the security incident handling process and facilitate the real-time activities of incident handlers.

Goals:

* Provide a platform for use by defenders to rapidly discover and respond to security incidents.
* Automate interfaces to other systems like bunker, banhammer, mig
* Provide metrics for security events and incidents
* Facilitate real-time collaboration amongst incident handlers
* Facilitate repeatable, predictable processes for incident handling
